As there is not a direct function of pandas that performs this step, it´s been step-by-step code, where we begin with the computation of the quartiles, then the IQR (Inter Quartile Range) and finally the upper and lower limit."

Conversely, smaller values show that the middle values cluster more tightly.\n",

    "To visualize the interquartile range, imagine dividing your data into quarters. Statisticians refer to these quarters as quartiles and label them from low to high as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. The lowest quartile (Q1) covers the smallest quarter of values in your dataset. The upper quartile (Q4) comprises the highest quarter of values. The interquartile range is the middle half of the data that lies between the upper and lower quartiles. In other words, the interquartile range includes the 50% of data points that are above Q1 and below Q4.\n",
    "\n",
    "When measuring variability, statisticians prefer using the interquartile range instead of the full data range because extreme values and outliers affect it less. Typically, use the IQR with a measure of central tendency, such as the median, to understand your data’s center and spread. This combination creates a fuller picture of your data’s distribution.\n",

Moreover inside each group we have also assigned each varible a level, *primary* or *secondary*, depending on their level of relevance.

Furthermore, the first assumption has to happen in 80% of the secondary indicators to avoid any fortuity.\" \n",
