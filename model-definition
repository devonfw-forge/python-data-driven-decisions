# Data Normalization

In this section it will be explained how the data has been normalized.

All the files.csv used in the project use different formats to present the data and for this reason the tables have to be adjusted. For example, 
in FAOSTAT countries are collected under the column of "Area", whereas in Databank is "Country". Through Python all columns will be renamed to 
use a common name among all files.

The format of the tables will be the following:

Country | Year | Indicator | Value

# Data Integration

On the other hand, the integration is an easier process. Consists in merging the different normalized files in to a single csv containing all
the data.
